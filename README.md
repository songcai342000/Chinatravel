The project uses widely query strings to load different contents. When a user click a link on the website, the program loads either a html file or a UserControl according to the correspondent query string. The website shows the information about the cities in interest, the packages of the travel agency, visa, online contract, and information about the travel agency, etc. The website has additionally functions such as online booking, automatic advertisement choosing and so on. Generally the website is information and function rich. The graphical design of the website is neaty but not boring.
